# One Click Dapp
Paste an ABI and get a permanent link that can be used to interact with that contract


## Goal

The goal of this project is to make it easier to interact with smart contracts deployed to ethereum.  Currently it is a pain to interact with simple contracts a developer has deployed.  They can use remix or truffle, but there is no way to send a link to a friend and have them be able to call function on the contract, unless a developer builds a whole front end themselves.

## Features


## Planned
- accounts to save your own pastes and links
- custom domain endings
